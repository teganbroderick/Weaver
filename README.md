## Introduction
I have been teaching myself to weave on a four-harness table loom for the last two years. I wanted to create a program where I could visualize weaving patterns, play around with pattern combinations/variations, and create a visual weaving sample to reference when actually weaving. Hence, Weaver was born.  


## Using Weaver
1. Open Weaver in Repl.it - <https://repl.it/@TeganBroderick/Weaver>
2. In the “console” tab, choose either an ‘easy’ or ‘hard’ difficulty level for the warp.
   - Easy: Easy warps are recommended for beginning weavers, as they’re easier to set up and are faster to weave.  
   - Hard: Harder warps are recommended for intermediate to advanced weavers. They are more difficult to set up and weave, but there are more complex patterns available.
3. Select a pattern from the list by typing the number into the console.
4. Click on the “result” tab to see the pattern being drawn.  
5. Click back to the “console” tab to continue the pattern, or select a new pattern.
5. Click on the “result” tab to see the pattern being drawn.  Repeat these steps to draw the pattern you wish to create.
7. Once you’re done, click back to the “console” tab and end the program. The program will create a list of patterns that you’ve chosen for your fabric for your reference.

## Troubleshooting
Weaver requires clicking back and forth between the ‘console’ and ‘result’ tabs. If nothing seems to be happening in the program, you might need to click on the other tab. Each time you return to the ‘console’ tab, you need to click inside the console window before you can enter anything.
